# Overview
The Sortoliser was created to serve as a learning tool to help people understand the process behind a variety of sorting algorithms. It is written primarily in JavaScript and designed to be used and interacted with as a webpage. I hoped that, by making this project, I would be able to learn more about JavaScript and learn a variety of common sorting algorithms myself.
